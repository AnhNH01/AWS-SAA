**General purpose**: (SSD)
- gp2: older, throughput and IOPS linked
- gp3: newer, can increase through put and IOPS independently
- Usecase: Transactional workloads, virtual desktops,...
- Boot volume

**Provisioned IOPS SSD Volumes** (if need more than 16000 IOPS)
- io1: High throughput and IOPS
- io2 Block Express: highest IOPS and throughput 
- Use cases: Workload that requires high throughput and IOPS
- Support Multiattach

**HDD volumes**
- st1: low cost for data that is frequently accessed (Big data, data warehousing)
- sc1: lowest cost for infrequenly accessed data
