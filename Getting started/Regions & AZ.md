*AWS infrastructure main point is **redundancy***

- AZ (Availability Zone): 1 or more data centers connected
- Regions: 3 or more Availability zone, separated from each other to prevent disaster from cascading
- Connected by high bandwidth, ultra-low latency network

*Most services are region-scoped*

- IAM (Access control)
- Route 53 (DNS)
- CloudFront (CDN)
